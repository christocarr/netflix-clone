# Netflix Clone

This Netflix clone was created to learn modern React practices including compound components, React hooks, Firebase, and styled components.

### Tech

This Netflix clone uses the following tech:

* [React] - yes, react
* [styled-components] - ES6 and CSS in one. Making styling more developer friendly which is still a debate amongst many.
* [hooks] - the new easier way to create functional react components and to share state amongst components without prop drilling.
* [Firebase]

### Installation

```sh
